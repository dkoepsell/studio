# **App Name**: ActiveReader

## Core Features:

- Text Import: Import text from PDF or DOC files.
- AI Annotation Guide: Use AI to demonstrate ideal annotation strategies for active reading. The AI should function as a tool to augment the users understanding of the text.
- Interactive Annotation: Allow students to highlight, annotate, and save text selections.
- AI Annotation Guide: Provide an AI-powered annotation guide only after a student has attempted to annotate the text and explicitly requests it. Before this, the application should provide a legend for annotation types and basic guidance on using the annotation tools.
- Performance Feedback: Provide tailored tips to improve annotation and summarization skills based on AI analysis of user's attempts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calm focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for clean, distraction-free reading.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFAB40) to highlight key interactive elements and annotations. The combination of the orange against the light blue is inviting, like an open fire on a cold day, so students will associate the action of selecting and annotating the text with something positive. The choice of warm hues nods to design styles from the late 1970s, when modern academic reading instruction came of age.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts.
- Simple, intuitive icons for annotations and tools.
- Clear, modular layout emphasizing readability and easy navigation.
- Subtle, non-distracting animations for feedback and actions.
